WazPay is a specialized Android application designed to automate offline UPI payment flows using the USSD *99# infrastructure. By leveraging Android Accessibility Services, the app provides a hands free experience for mobile banking without internet connectivity. This solution is ideal for users in low connectivity areas or those seeking a reliable backup to data dependent payment apps.

## Benefits of Offline UPI Payments

Offline banking via USSD offers several critical advantages for modern users:

*   **Zero Internet Dependency:** Complete transactions in areas with no data coverage, such as rural regions, underground basements, or during network outages.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Since USSD uses the signaling channel of the GSM network, it does not require an active data plan or high speed internet.
*   **Universal Accessibility:** Works on any SIM card registered with a bank for *99# services, providing a vital bridge for financial inclusion.
*   **Emergency Reliability:** When mobile apps fail due to server issues or poor 4G/5G signals, USSD remains a stable and resilient alternative for sending money.
*   **Battery Preservation:** Offline transactions consume significantly less power than data heavy payment applications.

## Key Features

*   **Automated *99# Navigation:** Automatically handles complex multi step menus including PIN entry, amount input, and recipient selection.
*   **Intelligent USSD Parser:** Uses advanced regex logic to identify screen states and extract transaction reference IDs in real time.
*   **Integrated QR Scanner:** Uses ML Kit and CameraX to scan UPI QR codes and extract payment details for immediate offline processing.
*   **Manufacturer Compatibility:** Built with a multi strategy button detection engine to ensure functionality across Samsung, Xiaomi, Pixel, and other Android skins.
*   **Modular Clean Architecture:** High performance codebase with a strict separation between UI components and core automation logic.

## Advantages of the New Architecture

The refactored modular structure provides significant technical benefits:

*   **Enhanced Reliability:** The multi strategy button detection logic solves the problem of manufacturer specific USSD dialog layouts.
*   **Real Time Adaptation:** The dynamic parser reads screen text to find menu options, making the app resilient to bank side menu changes.
*   **Scalable State Management:** Centralized PreferenceManager ensures all transaction data is handled securely and consistently.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Separating business logic from the UI reduces memory overhead and improves response times during automation.

## Project Structure

*   app/src/main/java/com/zeny/wazpay/MainActivity.kt: Core navigation controller and entry point.
*   app/src/main/java/com/zeny/wazpay/UssdService.kt: The Accessibility Service worker that executes the automation.
*   app/src/main/java/com/zeny/wazpay/logic/: Business rules including UssdParser, UssdState, and PreferenceManager.
*   app/src/main/java/com/zeny/wazpay/ui/screens/: Modular Jetpack Compose UI components.

## Technical Implementation

1.  **Accessibility Service:** The UssdService monitors window events to detect system dialogs and interacts with them using programmatic clicks and text entry.
2.  **Pattern Matching:** The logic layer identifies specific prompts (Welcome, IFSC, Pin, Amount) by analyzing screen text patterns.
3.  **Security:** All sensitive data like UPI PINs are handled within the app's secure private storage and only used during active automation sessions.

## 📱 Download & Installation

Pre-built APK binaries are available for every official release! You do not need to install Android Studio or build the project from source to test the app.
